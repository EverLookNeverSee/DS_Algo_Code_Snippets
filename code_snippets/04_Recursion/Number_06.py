    String Permutation

    Problem:
        Given a string, write a function that uses recursion to output
        list of all the possible permutations of that string.

        For example: given s = 'abc'
            The function should return ['abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cab', 'cba']

    Note: If a character is repeated, treat each occurrence as distinct. For
          example an input of 'XXX' would return a list with 6 versions of 'XXX'.
