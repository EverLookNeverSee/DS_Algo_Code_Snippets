"""
    Problem:
        Create a function called word_split which takes in a string phrase
        and a set list_of_words. The function then will determine if it is
        possible to split the string in a way in which words can be made from
        the list of words. You can assume the phrase will only contain words
        found in a dictionary if it is completely splittable.
