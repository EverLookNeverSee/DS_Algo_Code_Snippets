    Sentence Reversal

    Problem:
        Given a string of words, reverse all the words.
        For Example:
            Input --> "This is the best"
            Output --> "best the is This"

    Note: As part of ths exercise, you should remove all leading and trailing
          whitespaces. So that inputs such as:
                "   space here" and "space here     "
          both become:
                "here space"
