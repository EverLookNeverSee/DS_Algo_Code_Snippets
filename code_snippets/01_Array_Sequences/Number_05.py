    Find The Missing Element

    Problem:
        Consider an array of non-negative integers. A second array is formed by shuffling
        the elements of the first array and deleting a random element. Given these two a-
        -rrays, find which element is missing in second array.

        Here is an example of input, the first array is shuffled  and the number 5 is re-
        moved to construct the second array.

        Input:
            finder([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], [3, 7, 2, 1, 4, 6])

        output:
            5 is the missing number.
