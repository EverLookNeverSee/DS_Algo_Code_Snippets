    Balanced Parenthesis Check

    Problem:
        Given an string of opening and closing parenthesis, check whether it's
        balanced. We have 3 types of parenthesis: round brackets -> (), square
        brackets -> [] and curly bracket -> {}. Assume that the string doesn't
        contain any other character than these, no spaces, words or numbers. As
        a reminder, balanced parenthesis require every opening parenthesis to
        be closed in the reversed order opened.

        For Example:
            input --> ({}) is balanced,     output --> True
            input --> ({]) is'nt balanced,  output --> False
